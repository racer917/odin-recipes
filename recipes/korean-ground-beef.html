        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p>Remember as a general rule of thumb for any ingredients:

            containing seed oils.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb. lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/3 head of garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>chili flakes</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon korean chili paste</li>
            <p>Optional:</p>
            <li>sliced green onions</li>
            <li>sesame seeds</li>
            <li>sunny side up egg</li>
            <li>siracha mayo</li>
            <li>avocado</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook ground beef in golf-ball-sized pieces on high heat until slightly 
                seared on the outside and still pink on the inside.</li>
            <li>While the ground beef is cooking, mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Once, step 1 is complete, break up the ground beef and add the minced garlic, 
                reducing the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Separately, mix the sugar, soy sauce, ground ginger, sesame oil, chili flakes, and pepper 
                in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the ground beef is a minute or two away from being done, add the sauce
                to the beef in the pan and mix. Then add the korean chili paste, letting
                it melt in the beef and sauce. Let this cook for ~ 2min until the sauce thickens a tad.</li>
            <li>Add onto a serving of rice.</li>
            <li>Optional but recommended, add green onions, sesame seeds, avocado, siracho and even a fried egg
                on top and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
